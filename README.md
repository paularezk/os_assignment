# Banker Algorithm App using Flutter

This is a Flutter app that implements the Banker's algorithm, a deadlock avoidance algorithm used in operating systems. The app takes in user input for maximum resource allocation, current resource allocation, and resource availability, and then outputs whether or not there is a deadlock. If there is no deadlock, the app also animates the output.

## Installation

To install the app, clone the repository from GitHub and open it in your preferred IDE for Flutter development. Then, run the following command in your terminal:

flutter run


Make sure you have the Flutter SDK installed on your machine before attempting to run the app.

## Usage

To use the app, enter the maximum resource allocation, current resource allocation, and resource availability for each process in the designated fields. Then, click the "Check for Deadlock" button to see if there is a deadlock.

If there is no deadlock, the app will display an animation of the safe sequence of processes.
