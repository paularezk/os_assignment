# Banker Algorithm in Flutter

This is a Flutter project that implements the Banker Algorithm. The Banker Algorithm is an algorithm used in Operating Systems to avoid deadlocks. The algorithm works by checking if granting a request for resources will leave the system in a safe state, i.e., a state where no deadlocks will occur.

## Usage

To use this app, you will need to enter the following information:

- Max resources: The maximum amount of each resource that the system can allocate.
- Allocation: The amount of each resource that is currently allocated to each process.
- Available resources: The amount of each resource that is currently available to the system.

Once you have entered this information, the app will tell you if there is a deadlock or not. If there is no deadlock, the app will animate the output using a loading bar that is split to the number of processes.
